        <h1>How To Overcome the Habit of Staying Up Late</h1>
    <p>&nbsp; This makes sense; it has its advantages to stay up. You get to do all the things that you feel you want to do without being bothered. It can be fun, whether it's for video games, messaging your family, or fear for the next day. However, staying up late becomes difficult over time if you're depressed or rushing to finish work on a school night. It causes the next day's stress, makes you easily irritated, and affects the next day's performance. Here are some tips to help you stop staying up late at night: </p>

    <dt>Find Your Right Sleeping Time</dt>
        <dd>Assigning a random time to sleep is not always the best idea, says Kennedy. Besides the issues of going to bed too late and not getting enough sleep, you may have trouble falling or staying asleep if you go to bed too early. 
        See yourself while you sleep in varying amounts. After six hours, are you raring to go or do you just need eight to work well? Function backwards to find the ideal time to sleep, starting with your wake-up time. Step up at 5 a.m. Are you going to the gym? Would you have flex time allowing you to sleep up to 8 a.m.? To assess the best sleep condition, use your own circumstances and desires.<br><br>
        If you are planning ahead to a special event when you need to be up later, try to optimize your total sleep obtained in the week preceding it. Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep to feel rested. 
        Younger people may need even more sleep. If you are unsure if you are sleep deprived, consider a method of going to bed at a regular time and allowing yourself to sleep in.<br><br>
        Beyond hours of sleep, you also want to be mindful of your sleep quality. Poor sleep may occur most often due to untreated sleep apnea. Sleep apnea involves repeated fragmentation of sleep due to breathing 
        disturbances. These awakenings may undermine the quality of sleep. When sleep apnea occurs, daytime sleepiness may result, and this can make it hard to stay up later. Treatment of sleep disorders improves 
        sleep.</dd>

    <dt>Limit technology</dt>
    <dd>Whether it's watching the new House of Cards season binge-watching or taking the Facebook quiz "What Leader Were You in a Past Life," technology can be a major contributor to sleep procrastination. It is no surprise that a study by researchers in Norway in February 2015 found a strong correlation between electronic device usage and adolescent sleep deprivation.
        The study of the University of Utrecht found that people who are not good at self-regulation were more likely to procrastinate at bedtime.<br><br></dd>

    <dt>Establish Bedtime Rituals</dt>
    <dd>Going into a bedtime routine won't make you comfortable immediately, but having routines will help foster healthier sleeping habits, says Rothstein. After a specific time, power down phones. Switch to your pyjamas. Choose the most relaxing activities for you. They may include a warm drink, a bath, reading, newspapering, or music that is calming.<br><br>
        "You also need to know how long you need to prepare for sleep," says Rothstein. Some people are taking longer than others. She sets an alarm to remind her when it's time to get ready to go to bed.<br><br>
        But don't take routines in bedtime to the extreme, warns Kennedy. For example, she says, you can get too caught up in the prescribed routine and find yourself unable to sleep if you do not have your aromatherapy machine.</dd>

<dt>Stop Beating Yourself Up</dt>
    <dd>Sleep will never be a flawless activity, so stop berating yourself if you can't snooze on time, says Kennedy. The best thing you can do is continue to analyze and practice what works for you.
        "When you lie there and start all this, ' Tomorrow I'm going to feel so horrible, ' ' It's going to be terrible, ' you're just creating a stress response that makes the problem worse," she says.

    <dt>Recognize Sleepiness and Take Countermeasures</dt>
    <dd>You need to understand what takes you out of sleep, says Nancy H. Rothstein.
        Look at what you're doing instead of going to bed, she says, and wonder why you're doing it. If you're playing catch-up constantly, try looking at the places you're falling behind and taking steps to rectify them.</dd>

    <p> &nbsp; There's no one-size-fits-all plan or trick to stop you from staying up late at night. And sometimes for a moment one idea works, then you find yourself again at night. It's normal and expected; after all, we're just human. What is crucial is that you continue to try. Just execute the routine very differently and keep track of what you do in a newspaper (pen and paper or digitally) every night. So you can look back and see what you can do to improve your sleep the next day.</p>
