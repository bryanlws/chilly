<h1>Bad news night-owls: Staying up late could be killing you</h1>

<p>Are you an owl in the night or a lark in the morning? Naturally, some people gravitate to stay up late, and while genetics play a major role in setting up your body clock, some research suggests later bedtime might be bad for your health. A new large-scale observational study involving data from almost half a million people found that night owls have a 10% higher risk of dying earlier than before.</p>

<p>For six-and-a-half years, the study tracked 433,268 subjects. The subjects were divided into four self-reported categories between the ages of 38 and 73: definite type of morning, moderate type of morning, moderate type of evening, or definite type of evening. Even after adjustment for a variety of variables, including smoking, body mass index and pre-existing health conditions, the "definite type of evening" was associated with a 10% higher mortality risk than the "definite type of morning." Night owls were also seen to have higher rates of diabetes and psychological or neurological disorders.</p>

<p>The study's biggest debate is how to interpret these results. A fascinating side detail noted in the paper was the similarity between the different categories of reported overall sleep duration. This means that those who went to bed later at night still reported the same amount of sleep overall as those who went to bed early. People who are up late may have an internal biological clock that doesn't match their external environment," co-lead author Kristen Knutson hypothesizes. "It could be psychological stress, eating their body at the wrong time, not exercising enough, not sleeping enough, being alone awake at night, maybe using drugs or alcohol. The suggestion that night owls have a higher morbidity rate due to increased exposure to artificial light and, as a result, lower levels of melatonin is an interesting idea raised in the paper. It is a compelling hypothesis, supported by some research that links low melatonin levels with higher diabetes rates and some cancers.</p>

<p>The research team is now looking forward to further study trying to find out whether shifting night owls to earlier sleep schedules leads to overall improvements in health. The big question is whether many of the negative health effects associated with night owl behavior are simply because the world is more prepared for morning types, and night behaviors simply clash with social behaviour. If we can recognize that these chronotypes are partly genetically determined and not just a character flaw, jobs and working hours might have more flexibility for owls," Knutson says. "They shouldn't have to get up for an 8 a.m. shift. Make work shifts match the chronotypes of the people. Some people might be better suited for night shifts." Knutson and the team suggest several tips for night owls that could help optimize their health, including regimented bedtime, improved awareness of negative lifestyle behaviors (such as late-night eating), and attempts to expose them to as much morning and daylight as possible.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Chronobiology International.</p>
