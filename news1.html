    <h1>New Study Says That People Who Stay Up Late May Die Early</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;According to a news posted by 
    <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/new-study-says-people-who-stay-up-late-could-be-more-likely-to-die-early">Fox13news</a>
    , there is a recent United Kingdom scientific study showed that, night owls had a higher risk of early death than 
    people in the evening.</p>

    <img src="Image/study.jpg" alt="study" style="float:right">

    <p>&nbsp;The study was conducted over six-and-a-half years and observed almost half a million people's sleeping 
        habits. They discovered that those who wanted to stay up late were 10% more likely to die during the 
        analysis than those who chose to go to bed early and get up early â€” although both classes reported getting 
        about the same amount of sleep overall.</p>

    <p>Diabetes, psychological disorders, and neurological disorders were also more vulnerable to night owls.</p>

    <p>The study authors claim it is because most night owls who are programmed for a different time period 
        still have to live in a world designed for people in the afternoon. So they might sometimes do things 
        like working or eating that are not good for their bodies.</p>

    <p>The researchers said it could have positive effects for those who are already predisposed to stay up 
        late to have supervisors that encourage workers to come in early. Of reality, for someone whose best 
        friend is their snooze key, that's actually not true.</p>
