    <h1>Effects of staying up late</h1>
    <p>&nbsp; Staying up late is not good everyone as it brings negative effects to us
        no matter who u are. Here are some effects of buring midnight oil: </p>
    <div>
        <div>
            <img src="Image/hbs.jpg" alt="high blood sugar" style="float:left;">

        <dt>High Blood Sugar</dt>
            <dd>A 2015 study found health problems related to those with an evening-driven routine, such as high blood sugar. 
            While the experiment performed with a fairly small sample size, the findings showed that women who stayed up late 
            were also more likely to have high blood sugar. Hyperglycemia is often linked with other health conditions, ranging 
            from temporary problems such as exhaustion or nausea to more severe conditions such as cardiovascular disease or 
            harm to the kidneys.</dd>

        </div>
        <dt>Poor Eating Habit</dt>
            <dd>Late-night binges are all-too-commonÂ to anyone who has performed an all-night analysis or down a YouTube beauty 
                clip rabbit hole. One study found, though, that staying up late makes you eat more and worse, sometimes. As the 
                results of this study show, if we stay up beyond our bedtime, we start to desire denser nutrition with less healthy 
                types of fat, which can potentially lead to poor health.</dd>

        </div>
        <dt> Heart Disease</dt>
            <dd>One study suggests that you may always hurt your safety. Researchers named this "personal jet lag" sleep pattern 
                and related the heart disease to its effects. In fact, researchers found that you increase your risk of heart 
                disease by 11% for every hour that changes your sleep schedule.</dd>

            <img src="Image/depression.png" alt="depression" style="float:right">
        </div>
        <dt> Depression </dt>
            <dd>Researchers found in a recent study that individuals who see themselves as night owls were also more likely 
                to report depression symptoms and encounters. This was particularly true of participants who stayed up late 
                and had type-2 diabetes as well. Although not inherently a correlation between cause and effect, it is worth 
                noting that to some extent the two seem to be connected.</dd>

            <dd>It's often learned that getting enough sleep every night for at least six to eight hours is great. Everyone 
                has a specific situation, it's real. The truth is you should have enough rest to make your body work well 
                again.You'd accept that without sleep it's impossible to work like a machine. If you take a rest, your brain 
                will reorganize all of the details. You'd probably wake up late when you go to bed late and feel you don't 
                have enough sleep and don't work effectively. Operating with good focus is difficult for you. That might
                explain why focusing when you don't have enough sleep is so difficult.</dd>
    </div>
    <p> &nbsp; Hope these effects could increase your awareness on staying up late. Never ever burn the midnight oil anymore.</p>
